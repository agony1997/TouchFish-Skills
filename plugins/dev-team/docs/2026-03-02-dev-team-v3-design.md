# dev-team v3.0 Design Document

> Date: 2026-03-02
> Status: Draft
> Based on: `2026-03-02-v3-exploration.md` (35 design decisions)
> Breaking change from: v2.2.0

---

## 1. Motivation

v2.2.0 has structural problems that cannot be fixed incrementally:

- **TL bottleneck**: 33 responsibilities across planning, tracking, QA, communication
- **Context degradation**: persistent Workers lose instruction compliance after 3-4 tasks
- **Tracking overhead**: 5 output files (TRACE, CONTRACT, PROCESS_LOG, ISSUES, DELIVERY) with heavy TL maintenance
- **Challenger ROI**: persistent challenger idles most of the time, consumes context
- **Same-source test bias**: Worker writes both code and tests — shared blind spots

v3.0 is a ground-up redesign, not a patch.

---

## 2. Core Principles

| # | Principle | Description |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| P1 | **Focus on team orchestration** | Task planning, contract management, conflict protection, tracking, delivery. Do NOT replicate superpowers (methodology) or OpenSpec (spec lifecycle) |
| P2 | **Plugin-independent + detection-enhanced** | Core flow has zero hard dependencies. Auto-detect other plugins → upgrade experience. Separate Recommended Integrations doc |
| P3 | **Single-skill full flow** | One SKILL.md covers P0-P5. Team orchestration is stateful — skill chains don't fit |
| P4 | **Files are memory** | All critical decisions write to files. LLM context is unreliable short-term memory. Filesystem = source of truth |

---

## 3. Architecture Overview

### 3.1 Team Structure

```
TL (Opus) — Sole planner + quality gate + spawn authority
├── test-agent-N (Opus, sub-agent) — writes tests BEFORE Worker codes
├── worker-N (Sonnet, teammate) — 1 task per worker, TL-assigned
├── qa-task-N (Sonnet, sub-agent) — three-way cross-verification per task
├── qa-global (Opus, sub-agent) — cross-task consistency (Phase 4)
└── delivery-sub (Sonnet, sub-agent) — assembles DELIVERY.md (Phase 5)
```

**Key changes from v2.2.0:**
- Challenger removed — responsibilities absorbed by per-task QA + global review
- Workers are 1-task-per-worker (no self-assignment, no persistence)
- test-agent is a new role (separated testing)
- QA split into per-task (Sonnet) and global (Opus)

### 3.2 Phase Structure (6 → 5 Phases)

| Phase | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| P0 | Reconnaissance | Detect explorer/PROJECT_MAP, scan project |
| P1 | Requirements Analysis + Task Planning | Produce PLAN.md (LLM-native) + temp human summary |
| P2 | API Contract | Produce CONTRACT.md (LLM-native) + temp human summary. SKIP IF no API |
| P3 | Development Execution | Per-task loop: test-agent → Worker → QA. Merged old P3+P4 |
| P4 | Global Review | Cross-task consistency + contract compliance. Merged old P5+P6 |
| P5 | Delivery | DELIVERY.md (Markdown) + cleanup |

### 3.3 File Architecture

| File | Nature | Writer | Reader | Format |
|------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| PLAN.md | Static (write once) | TL (P1) | Workers, QA | LLM-native |
| CONTRACT.md | Living (amendment flow) | TL (P2 + amendments) | Workers, QA | LLM-native |
| DELIVERY.md | Static | P5 sub-agent or TL | Humans | Markdown |
| logs/tl.log.md | Append-only | TL | P5 sub-agent | LLM-native |
| logs/worker-N.log.md | Append-only | Each Worker | P5 sub-agent | LLM-native |
| logs/qa-task-N.log.md | Append-only | Each QA sub-agent | P5 sub-agent | LLM-native |
| temp/*.md | Ephemeral | TL | Humans (confirmation) | Markdown |

**Removed from v2.2.0:** TRACE.md, PROCESS_LOG.md, ISSUES.md (replaced by TaskList + logs/)

### 3.4 LLM-Native File Format

All working files (PLAN, CONTRACT, logs) use LLM-optimized format:

```
[SECTION] Section Name

[KEY] value
[KEY] value | sub-value | sub-value

[ENTRY] type=xxx | status=xxx | detail=xxx
```

Rules:
- Structured prefix: `[TYPE]` at line start
- Flat key-value, avoid nesting
- Pipe-delimited (`|`) for multi-value fields
- Block markers: `[SECTION]` instead of `## Section`
- No formatting decorations (no tables, no alignment)
- ~40% more token-efficient than Markdown tables

Human-readable output is ONLY for:
- temp/ summaries (P1/P2 confirmation, one-time, not maintained)
- DELIVERY.md (the sole formal human document)

---

## 4. Phase Details

### Phase 0: Reconnaissance

1. Detection-enhanced integration scan (see §7.5)
2. If `explorer` skill detected → invoke explorer → wait for PROJECT_MAP.md
3. If PROJECT_MAP.md already exists → read directly, skip explorer
4. If neither → manual scan: root structure, tech stack, entry points, configs, shared components, standards
5. AskUserQuestion: existing spec file locations, PROJECT_MAP path (if any), conventions
6. If `.standards/` or standards file found → read and incorporate

### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis + Task Planning (TL solo)

1. Read user requirements/specs

2. AskUserQuestion: output directory (default: `docs/dev-team/<feature>/`)
   - All output files use date prefix: `YYYY-MM-DD-`
   - Create `logs/` subdirectory

3. Multi-spec assessment (if multiple specs):
   - Analyze cross-domain relationships
   - Shared file identification
   - AskUserQuestion: Parallel / Sequential / Single-focus

4. Reference PROJECT_MAP.md for architecture, reusable components, project standards
   - If adjacent code doesn't follow documented standards → note discrepancy in PLAN

5. Scope check: verify requirements vs current codebase
   - If significant portions already implemented → AskUserQuestion to adjust scope

6. TaskCreate: break into tasks
   - **Task granularity anchor**: each task ALLOWED files ≤ 5
   - One clear function per task (describable in one sentence)
   - \> 5 ALLOWED files → must split
   - 1 ALLOWED file + trivial logic → merge into adjacent task
   - Define blockedBy/blocks dependencies
   - If two tasks need the same file → same worker OR blockedBy

   Each task description MUST include:
   ```
   ## File Scope
   - ALLOWED: <files this task can modify, max 5>
   - READONLY: <files for reference only>
   ```

7. Write PLAN.md (LLM-native format):
   ```
   [SECTION] Project Overview
   [GOAL] {one-line project goal}
   [ARCH] {key architectural decisions}
   [NAMING] {naming conventions to follow}
   [CONSTRAINTS] {critical constraints}
   [SHARED] {cross-task shared resources}

   [SECTION] Integrations
   [DETECT] {integration detection results from P0}

   [SECTION] Standards
   [SOURCE] {where standards come from}
   [OVERRIDE] follow-actual-code | {noted discrepancies}
   ```
   Target size: ~500-1500 tokens

8. Write temp/plan-summary.md (human-readable, for user confirmation)

9. AskUserQuestion: confirm task list, acceptance criteria, priority
   - Present: task count, estimated Worker spawns (≤ 3 concurrent)

### Phase 2: API Contract (TL solo)

**SKIP IF**: requirements contain no API endpoints. Note "P2: SKIP (no API)" in PLAN.

1. Write CONTRACT.md (LLM-native format):
   ```
   [SECTION] API Contract
   [VERSION] 1

   [ENDPOINT] method=POST | path=/api/users | req={schema} | res={schema} | errors=400,404,500
   [ENDPOINT] method=GET | path=/api/users/:id | req=none | res={schema} | errors=404,500

   [SECTION] Shared Types
   [TYPE] name=User | fields=id:string,name:string,email:string

   [SECTION] Error Format
   [FORMAT] {code: number, message: string, details?: object}
   ```

2. Write temp/contract-summary.md (human-readable, for user confirmation)

3. AskUserQuestion: confirm contract

4. Contract amendment rule: any change requires TL approval
   - TL modifies CONTRACT.md → increments [VERSION]
   - Affected Workers: shutdown → spawn new Worker with updated contract
   - QA verifies contract compliance for all related tasks

### Phase 3: Development Execution

TeamCreate: `"dev-<project>-<feature>"`

**Per-task execution loop** (≤ 3 Workers concurrent):

```
For each executable task (no blockedBy, status=pending):

  1. TL spawns test-agent (Opus, sub-agent)
     → Reads: task description + PLAN.md + CONTRACT.md
     → Produces: test file(s) — red/green tests, boundary tests, error cases
     → Returns: test file paths

  2. TL spawns Worker (Sonnet, teammate)
     → Reads: PLAN.md + CONTRACT.md + task description + test files
     → Writes code to pass all tests
     → SendMessage TL: completion report (files changed, issues found)
     → Writes logs/worker-N.log.md
     → shutdown

  3. TL spawns QA (Sonnet, sub-agent)
     → Three-way cross-verification (see §7.3)
     → Writes logs/qa-task-N.log.md
     → Returns: PASS or FAIL with details
```

**TL Phase 3 flow:**
1. Pick executable tasks from TaskList → spawn ≤ 3 test-agent+Worker pairs
2. Wait for Worker completion/help requests
3. Complete → spawn QA → handle result:
   - PASS → TaskUpdate completed
   - FAIL → create fix task (re-enters loop)
4. Contract change needed → terminate affected Workers → amend → spawn new Workers
5. Repeat until all tasks completed

**Edge cases:**
- Worker needs file outside scope → SendMessage TL → TL adjusts or creates dependency
- Worker finds task too complex → SendMessage TL → TL splits
- Worker unresponsive (2 messages no reply) → TL assumes crash, reassign task, spawn replacement
- All available tasks blocked → TL coordinates unblocking

### Phase 4: Global Review

1. TL spawns qa-global (Opus, sub-agent):
   - Reads: ALL changed files, PLAN.md, CONTRACT.md, all qa-task logs
   - Checks:
     - Cross-task consistency (naming, patterns, error handling)
     - Contract compliance across all endpoints
     - Completeness: original requirements vs TaskList (gap analysis)
   - Returns: structured findings
   - Writes logs/qa-global.log.md

2. SKIP condition: if total tasks ≤ 2, skip Phase 4 (per-task QA is sufficient)

3. Issues found → create fix tasks → back to Phase 3

### Phase 5: Delivery

1. TL spawns delivery-sub (Sonnet, sub-agent):
   - Reads: PLAN.md, CONTRACT.md, all logs/*, TaskList dump
   - Produces: DELIVERY.md (see §6.3 for 8-section template)

2. TL sends shutdown_request to all remaining Workers (if any)

3. TL presents to user:
   - DELIVERY.md path
   - List of all output files
   - Summary of what was delivered

4. TeamDelete after all teammates confirmed shut down

5. Do NOT auto-commit/push. User decides.

## 5. Agent Specifications

### 5.1 Model Selection

| Agent | Model | Rationale |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| TL | Opus | Planning + judgment + management — needs strongest reasoning |
| Worker | Sonnet | Coding proficient, best cost-efficiency |
| test-agent | Opus | Boundary test design requires imagination — quality first |
| QA per-task | Sonnet | Checklist-driven review, Sonnet sufficient |
| QA global | Opus | Cross-project consistency judgment, runs once |
| delivery-sub | Sonnet | Structured compilation, no deep reasoning needed |

Haiku NOT used — DELIVERY.md is the only human-facing artifact, quality should not be compromised.

### 5.2 TL (Team Lead)

- Model: Opus
- Type: Main session (not spawned)
- Responsibilities (~15 items, down from 33):
  - P0: reconnaissance + integration detection
  - P1: requirements analysis, task creation, PLAN.md
  - P2: CONTRACT.md, amendment management
  - P3: spawn loop (test-agent → Worker → QA), handle results
  - P4: spawn qa-global
  - P5: spawn delivery-sub, cleanup
  - Cross-cutting: blocker resolution, contract amendments, Worker replacement

### 5.3 Worker

- Model: Sonnet
- Type: Teammate (1 task per worker)
- Lifecycle: spawn with task → execute → completion report → shutdown
- Reads on start: PLAN.md, CONTRACT.md, task description, test files
- Writes: code changes + logs/worker-N.log.md
- Communication: can SendMessage TL (help, completion, issues)
- Scope enforcement: strict File Scope (ALLOWED/READONLY)
- No self-assignment (TL assigns at spawn time)
- No peer communication (only TL ↔ Worker)

### 5.4 test-agent

- Model: Opus
- Type: Sub-agent (disposable)
- Input: task description + PLAN.md + CONTRACT.md
- Output: test file(s) with:
  - Red/green tests (basic functionality)
  - Boundary tests (edge cases, limits)
  - Error case tests (invalid input, failure paths)
- Does NOT write implementation code
- Fresh context per task (no degradation)

### 5.5 QA per-task

- Model: Sonnet
- Type: Sub-agent (disposable)
- Input: task description, code changes, test files, CONTRACT.md, project standards
- Method: Three-way cross-verification (see §7.3)
- Output: PASS/FAIL + structured findings
- Writes: logs/qa-task-N.log.md (before destruction)

### 5.6 QA Global

- Model: Opus
- Type: Sub-agent (disposable)
- Input: ALL changed files, PLAN.md, CONTRACT.md, all qa-task logs
- Checks: cross-task consistency, contract compliance, completeness
- Output: structured findings
- Writes: logs/qa-global.log.md

### 5.7 Delivery Sub-agent

- Model: Sonnet
- Type: Sub-agent (disposable)
- Input: PLAN.md, CONTRACT.md, all logs/*, TaskList dump
- Output: DELIVERY.md (8-section Markdown)

```
[LOG] phase=P1 | event=plan-created | tasks=8 | workers=3
[LOG] phase=P3 | event=contract-amendment | v=2 | reason=xxx | affected=worker-2
[LOG] phase=P3 | event=worker-replaced | worker=worker-1 | reason=unresponsive
```

[LOG] task=T-3 | event=issue | detail=existing UserService uses callback pattern, adapted to async
[LOG] task=T-3 | event=complete | files-changed=2 | tests-passed=all
[METRICS] model=sonnet | input=n/a | output=n/a | duration=180s
```

**logs/qa-task-N.log.md:**
```

[CHECK] spec-compliance=PASS
[CHECK] code-quality=PASS | note=minor: unused import in line 12
[CHECK] three-way=PASS | req-vs-test=aligned | test-vs-code=aligned | req-vs-code=aligned
[CHECK] file-scope=PASS
[RESULT] PASS
[METRICS] model=sonnet | input=12500 | output=850 | duration=45s
```

Rules:
- Each agent writes ONLY its own log
- Append-only (never edit previous entries)
- QA sub-agents write their log before returning result
- P5 delivery-sub reads all logs for compilation

---

## 7. Key Mechanisms

### 7.1 File Scope Enforcement (3 Layers)

| Layer | When | Who | Action |
|-------|------|-----|--------|
| Pre-execution | Task creation | TL | Ensure ALLOWED files don't overlap across concurrent tasks. Overlap → blockedBy |
| During execution | Coding | Worker | Must verify file is ALLOWED before editing. Need out-of-scope file → SendMessage TL |
| Post-execution | Review | QA | Check only ALLOWED files were modified. Scope violation → FAIL |

### 7.2 Contract Amendment Flow

```
Worker discovers contract issue
  → SendMessage TL: "CONTRACT needs change: {reason}"
  → TL evaluates
  → TL modifies CONTRACT.md, increments [VERSION]
  → TL identifies affected Workers
  → TL sends shutdown_request to affected Workers
  → Affected Workers shutdown (1-task = low loss)
  → TL spawns new Workers with updated CONTRACT.md
  → QA verifies contract compliance for all related tasks
```

Cost of termination is low because 1-task-per-worker means no cross-task knowledge lost.

### 7.3 Three-Way Cross-Verification (QA)

QA sub-agent performs three independent checks:

```
1. Requirements ↔ Tests
   - Do tests cover all acceptance criteria?
   - Are there requirements without corresponding tests?

2. Tests ↔ Code
   - Does code make all tests pass correctly (not just bypass)?
   - Are there code paths not covered by tests?

3. Requirements ↔ Code
   - Does code implement what was actually required?
   - Is there code that doesn't map to any requirement?
```

This is stricter than TDD — TDD trusts tests, three-way verification trusts NO single artifact.

### 7.4 Natural Degradation (No LITE/STANDARD Modes)

Instead of explicit modes, the flow naturally simplifies:

| Condition | Simplification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Few tasks (≤ 3) | Fewer Worker spawns |
| No API endpoints | Skip Phase 2 entirely |
| Tasks ≤ 2 | Skip Phase 4 global review |
| PLAN always produced | Files-are-memory principle — never skip |

User can also specify:
- Existing spec file locations
- PROJECT_MAP.md path
- Convention/standards file locations

### 7.5 Detection-Enhanced Integration

| Detection Target | Glob Pattern | Phase | Upgrade Behavior |
|-----------------|-------------|-------|-----------------|
| explorer skill | `**/skills/explorer/SKILL.md` | P0 | Found → invoke explorer for reconnaissance |
| PROJECT_MAP.md | `**/PROJECT_MAP.md` | P0 | Found → skip explorer, read directly |
| superpowers TDD | `**/skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md` | P1 | Found → test-agent uses strict TDD mode |
| reviewer skill | `**/skills/reviewer/SKILL.md` | P1 | Found → incorporate standard files |
| .standards/ | `.standards/**` | P1 | Found → read and include in PLAN |
| OpenSpec SDD | `**/docs/specs/*.md` | P1 | Found → can serve as requirements source |

Detection results written to PLAN.md `[SECTION] Integrations`.

### 7.6 Separated Testing

```
Traditional (v2.2.0):        v3.0 Separated:
  Worker writes code           test-agent (Opus) writes tests
  Worker writes tests          Worker (Sonnet) writes code to pass tests
  Same-source bias             Different-source, different model
```

- test-agent uses Opus for boundary test creativity
- Worker sees tests as a specification to satisfy
- QA verifies alignment between all three (requirements, tests, code)
- Extra cost: ~$0.25/task — justified by significant quality improvement

### 7.7 Standards Conflict Resolution

When existing code doesn't follow documented standards:

- Worker READONLY list includes both standards files AND adjacent actual code
- **Follow actual surrounding code style** (not blind standard compliance)
- TL notes discrepancies in PLAN.md `[OVERRIDE]` section
- Worker logs discrepancies in their log file
- DELIVERY.md Audit Trail presents inconsistencies found

---

## 8. Communication Rules

```
ALLOWED:
  TL ↔ Worker (instructions, help requests, completion reports)

FORBIDDEN:
  Worker ↔ Worker (no peer communication)
```

Communication discipline (embedded in Worker prompt):
- Receive message from TL → address it FIRST
- Complete task → SendMessage TL: what's done, files changed, issues
- STOP RULE (positive form): complete task → report. Hit problem → report. Receive pure acknowledgment → do NOT reply, continue working
- Worker prompt explicitly prohibits peer communication

### 8.1 TL Communication

TL operates in passive mode during Phase 3:
- Spawn Workers → wait for their messages
- React to: completion reports, help requests, contract change requests
- Proactive actions: replace unresponsive Workers, manage blockers

---

## 9. Metrics Design

Each agent records: model + input tokens + output tokens + wall-clock time.

```
[METRICS] model=xxx | input=xxx | output=xxx | duration=xxxs
```

| Agent Type | Token Data | Duration | Source |
|-----------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Sub-agents (test/QA/delivery) | Exact (from Agent tool `<usage>`) | Exact | Returned by tool |
| Workers (teammate) | n/a (API doesn't expose to AI) | Wall-clock | Self-reported |
| TL | Not recorded (is the session itself) | — | — |

- **No cost calculation** — pricing changes frequently, outside SKILL scope
- No Haiku mention in metrics (Haiku not used)
- Worker writes METRICS to their log file before completion report

---

## 10. Breaking Changes from v2.2.0

| Area | v2.2.0 | v3.0 |
|------|--------|------|
| Challenger | Persistent teammate, devil's advocate | **Removed** — absorbed by per-task QA + global review |
| Worker lifecycle | Persistent, self-assigns multiple tasks | **1 task per worker**, TL-assigned, shutdown after completion |
| Testing | Worker writes own tests | **Separated**: test-agent (Opus) writes tests → Worker codes |
| QA method | Checklist review | **Three-way cross-verification** (req ↔ test ↔ code) |
| Output files | 5 files (TRACE, CONTRACT, PROCESS_LOG, ISSUES, DELIVERY) | **4 files** (PLAN, CONTRACT, DELIVERY, logs/) + temp/ |
| File format | All Markdown | **LLM-native** for working files, Markdown only for DELIVERY |
| Tracking | TRACE.md (TL-maintained) | **TaskList** (native) + distributed logs |
| Phase count | 6 phases (P0-P6) | **5 phases** (P0-P5) |
| Task complexity | S/M/L scoring | **File count anchor** (ALLOWED ≤ 5) |
| Metrics | Cost estimates with hardcoded pricing | **Raw data only** (model, tokens, time), no cost |
| Mode selection | N/A (implicit) | **Natural degradation** (no explicit LITE/STANDARD) |
| Communication | TL ↔ all, challenger ↔ TL | **TL ↔ Worker only** (simplified) |
| DELIVERY | Simple report | **8-section development return document** |

---

## Appendix: Decision Traceability

All 35 decisions are documented in `2026-03-02-v3-exploration.md` §9 (consolidated decision table). This design document is the architectural implementation of those decisions.
